# C_Basic Topic 9

## Basic C++

In C++, we will include <iostream> to handle the IO in C++.

```
#include <iostream>

int main(){
  return 0;
}
```

## Variable declaration


```
int i{5};
int j = 9;
float x = 7.8;
```

## IO

```
int i;
cin >> i;
cout << i;
```

## if-else and flow control

Same as previous in C.

## Practice

Please rewrite homework in HW1-3 using C++.
